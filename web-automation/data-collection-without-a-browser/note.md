# üìò Data Collection Without Browser, Pre-rendering, and HTML Handling

In this lesson, we learn how to collect data without launching a browser, how to use Puppeteer for React app pre-rendering, and how to manage HTML files effectively.

## üö´ Data Collection Without Browser

You don't always need Puppeteer or Playwright to open a browser and fetch data. Often, you can retrieve raw data directly using APIs or static HTML pages.

### How it works:

- If the target website is API-driven or renders static content, you can simply use `fetch()` to retrieve the raw data.

### Example: Fetching data with Node.js fetch
```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://example.com");
  const html = await res.text();
  console.log(html); // Displays HTML content
}
getData();
```

## üß† Use of Data Preservation

Sometimes, the client may not clearly specify what data they need.

1. Initially save the HTML or JSON response.  
2. Later, if the client asks for the title of a page, you can extract it from the saved data instead of making a new request.

**This approach saves both time and server resources.**

## ‚öõÔ∏è Pre-rendering React Apps Using Puppeteer

React SPA apps usually render on the client-side, which is not SEO-friendly and lacks rich previews on social media.

**Solution:**  
Use Puppeteer to open the web page, fully render the DOM, and save it as static HTML.

### Use cases:
- For SEO purposes  
- To generate Open Graph previews for social media sharing

```js
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://your-react-app.com", { waitUntil: "networkidle2" });
  const html = await page.content();
  require("fs").writeFileSync("react-rendered.html", html);
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## üìù Managing HTML Files

An HTML file represents the full structure of a webpage. It is valuable for multiple purposes:

- Storing for future use  
- Parsing later with tools like Cheerio to extract titles, meta tags, etc.  
- Preparing content for server-side processing

### Example: Saving an HTML file using Node.js
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function saveHTML() {
  const res = await fetch("https://example.com");
  const html = await res.text();
  fs.writeFileSync("example.html", html);
}
saveHTML();
```

## üìö Summary of the Lesson

- You can collect data using `fetch()` or `curl` without launching a browser  
- Preserving raw data initially allows reuse without repeated requests  
- Puppeteer helps pre-render React apps for better SEO and social media previews  
- HTML files can be analyzed for metadata and used in server-side workflows
