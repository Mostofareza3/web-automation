# 🌐 Introduction to Web Automation

Web automation is the process of using software tools to automatically interact with websites. It is widely used for testing, scraping, form filling, and simulating user behavior in a browser.

This note introduces three popular tools used for web automation:

- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

---

## 🔧 Why Web Automation?

- ✅ Automated testing of websites  
- ✅ Filling out forms automatically  
- ✅ Taking screenshots or PDFs of pages  
- ✅ Scraping data from websites  
- ✅ Simulating human browsing behavior  

---

## 🚀 Tools Overview

### 1. Puppeteer

> Developed by Google for headless Chrome or Chromium automation.

- **Language**: JavaScript/Node.js  
- **Best for**: Chrome-specific automation, scraping, screenshots, PDFs  
- **Headless**: Yes (by default)

**Example:**
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();

2. Selenium

One of the oldest and most flexible tools, supporting multiple languages and browsers.

	•	Language: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.
	•	Best for: Cross-browser testing
	•	Headless: Supported

Example (JavaScript - WebDriver):

const { Builder } = require('selenium-webdriver');

(async () => {
  let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
  await driver.get('https://example.com');
  await driver.quit();
})();

3. Playwright

Developed by Microsoft, supports automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

	•	Language: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET
	•	Best for: Cross-browser automation, modern web apps
	•	Headless: Yes (default)

Example:

const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();

🧠 When to Use What?
	•	Puppeteer: If you’re only targeting Chrome and want fast performance.
	•	Selenium: If you need multi-language support and broad browser testing.
	•	Playwright: If you want modern, powerful, and fast cross-browser automation.

📚 Next Steps
	•	Learn DOM navigation and selectors (CSS, XPath)
	•	Handle forms, inputs, buttons
	•	Manage cookies, sessions, and localStorage
	•	Automate login and scraping content
	•	Deal with captchas and detection (advanced)
